# landing-page

This was a project assignmet of Odin Project under the CSS section where we had to build a landing page using HTML and CSS.
The website is not responsive, it's tailored for my specific laptop screen size so sorry if it looks messed up on yours :)

You can find the link to the final landing page here: https://shobhit-nagpal.github.io/landing-page/
